# whitelist-Dapp

Launching NFT collection named Crypto Devs. I want to give early supporters access to a whitelist for my collection, so here I'm creating an whitelist dapp for Crypto Devs.

**Requirements**
Whitelist access should be given to the first 10 users for free who want to get in.
There is a website where people can go and enter into the whitelist.

**N.B:**
This is a test project.

Tools use in creating this project.
-Solidity
-Hardhat
-Ethers.js
-Next.js
-Node.js
-JavaScript
-Deployed on the Rinkeby network
