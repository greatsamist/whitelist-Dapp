# whitelist-Dapp

Launching NFT collection named Crypto Devs. I want to give early supporters access to a whitelist for my [collection](https://github.com/greatsamist/nft-collection), so here I'm creating an whitelist dapp for Crypto Devs.

**Requirements** <br/>
Whitelist access should be given to the first 10 users for free who want to get in.
There is a website where people can go and enter into the whitelist.

<br> <br/>
**N.B:**
`This is a test project.`

**Tools used in creating this project.**  <br/>
- Solidity
- Hardhat
- Ethers.js
- React
- Next.js 
- Node.js
- JavaScript
- Deployed on the Rinkeby network
